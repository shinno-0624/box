        <p id="本文">aPhone SE is aPple's first smartphone, and here is the story behind its creation.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center">
          <div style="text-align: left;">
            <h2 style="margin-top: 1120px; font-weight: bold;">Why did you decide to develop aPhone?</h2>
            <p>Smartphone have become <u>indispensable devices in our daily lives these days</u>. However, I felt that there was <strong>something different about those smartphones</strong>.<br>For example, the performance. The performance of even high-end devices has <strong>reached a ceiling</strong>. The current situation may be the limit. I wondered if I could somehow fix such shortcomings. That's what we thought.<br>We went through a <strong>Trial-and-Error</strong> process to see if we could make a smartphone with high performance at a low price. The result was the <i>aPhone SE</i>.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 1120px; font-weight: bold;">Why did you concentrate on using your own CPU?</h2>
            <p>As I mentioned earlier, I would like to equip smartphones with performance that can be <strong>stretched to infinity</strong>. In order to achieve this, I thought that we needed to develop the <strong><i>most suitable CPU for our aPhone</i></strong>.<br>The development was <i>not an easy task</i> either. ow much high performance could we pack into a small chip? That was the most difficult part.<br>The CPU used in the aPhone SE is the <strong>A10 Bionic CPU</strong>. aPple is <u>still in its first stage</u> of development.<i>We are working on development every day, believing that we can make further progress.</i></p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 1120px; font-weight: bold;">What were you particularly conscious of in terms of design?</h2>
            <p><span style="font-size: 120%;">We wanted a design that was neither too flashy nor too simple to attract attention.</span>So, what kind of design should we make? As a result, we came up with a design like aPhone SE.<br>It comes in a <strong>Variety of colors</strong>, <strong>Has rounded sides</strong>, <strong>and a straight back</strong>. It is<i>Easy to place</i>, <i>Easy to hold</i>, and <i>Hard to fall off</i>. This design was the <u>best choice for us</u>.<br>We also paid a lot of attention to the color. We wanted a color that would suit everyone and not get boring. We also wanted a lineup of colors that would be easy to choose and make people want to choose. The <i>five colors are Black, White, Blue, Green, and Purple</i>.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 1120px; font-weight: bold;">Was there anything you devised for the aOS?</h2>
            <p><strong><i>Anyway, we pursued ease of use.</i></strong> First of all, we decided to develop an OS that is agile enough not to be left behind by the ultra-fast operation of aPhone. Then, we decided to develop an OS with excellent security features, so that anything can be done with a smartphone equipped with aOS. These items also absolutely had to be included.<br>"As far as I can remember, we had to recreate them about fifty times."<br>The aOS is the result of such repeated Trial and Error.<br>We are constantly updating this aOS, keeping it at the highest level of security in the world, and making it more useful.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 32px; font-weight: bolder">We hope you will continue to support us.</h2>
